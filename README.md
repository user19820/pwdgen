# Passwd

Simple password generator. Uses an extended character set and imposes minimum
length requirement to (hopefully) achieve decently strong passwords.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Results are directly copied to the user's clipboard.

Supports:
- darwin
- windows (needs testing!)

TODO:
- linux
- research better password generation algorithms
